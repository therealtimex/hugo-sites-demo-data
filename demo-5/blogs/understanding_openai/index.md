OpenAI is a research institute committed to ensuring that artificial general intelligence (AGI) benefits all of humanity. They aim to construct safe AGI, or to aid others in attaining this outcome.

Artificial General Intelligence refers to highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work. OpenAI's mission is to ensure that AGI's benefits are broadly distributed and used for the advantage of all, avoiding uses of AI or AGI that harm humanity or concentrate power unduly.

OpenAI adopts the principle of long-term safety and they commit to assist in the construction of a global community to address AGI's challenges. They have developed advanced AI models like GPT-3 and DALL-E. GPT-3 is a language prediction model that uses machine learning to produce human-like text, while DALL-E generates images from textual descriptions.

OpenAI has set spheres of competencies to ensure long-term safety, technical leadership, and a broad scope for AI and AGI's benefits.
